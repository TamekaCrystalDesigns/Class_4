				<img src="Images/tameka_profile_tint_5_bw.jpg">Hello, my name is Tameka. I'm currently the Online Media Specialist at NYU-ePoly, among top-ranked grad engineering schools by US News &#38; World Report. Currently, I assist with  enrollment marketing and lead generation efforts. I handle all creative requests for digital and print materials for upcoming events, website design and development, as well as website maintenance.

			I design and develop micro-websites and landing pages to promote NYU-ePoly&#39;s online graduate degree programs; also focusing on co-branded site pages for corporate client and society partners. I have successfully done project management, web design, and creative work for two of NYU School of Engineering&#39;s largest annual events:  <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/sloanseries" target="_blank">Cyber Security Lecture Series</a> and the <a href="http://enterprise.poly.edu/hci" target="_blank">Human Capital Innovation in Technology &#38; Analytics Conferences</a>.

			In addition, to my web and creative support I have managed several Google AdWords and Geo-Targeting campaigns. I also serve as a representative to NYU-ePoly&#39;s corporate partners and travel to partnership and client events to assist with marketing outreach and graduate student recruitment efforts.
